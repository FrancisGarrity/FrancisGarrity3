Hi, I'm Ilias Bartolini a participant to FabAcademy 2018 in Barcelona.

I have been a software engineer for 10+ years at [Ferrari F1](http://formula1.ferrari.com/en/) team and [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) working as a consultant internationally.  
I usually work as technical lead or engineering manager for software product teams and I like to support others as a coach and trainer in this field.

I have a small passion for photography and you might easily find me wandering around with my camera :)

I recently became very passionate about social justice: you can consider me an _'activist apprentice'_.  
I took part in various social movements in the last few years like the [Occupy movement](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iliasbartolini/sets/72157627775396809), [supporting refugees](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iliasbartolini/sets/72157659099618579), [fighting climate change](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iliasbartolini/albums/72157668379127415) and technology related.  
I keep trying to be an ally and to use my skills to make the world a better place.

I'm attending FabAcademy as a way to learn new skills to do this.  
I think that personal fabrication is a movement based on stong foundations of openness and sharing knowledge. It can help reducing our dependency from corporations and [empower people]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/03/25/tools-for-conviviality-and-the-digital-fabrication-movement.html).

My personal mantra is this quote from Anne Frank:
> _'Soit gentil et tiens courage'_

I currently share my time between Barcelona, Bologna and Berlin.
