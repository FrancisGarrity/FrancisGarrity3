In poorly facilitated meetings we often face the problem of few people taking up most of the discussion space. This behaviour is often consequence of biases on gender, ethnicity and more.  
"Conversation compass" is a smart speakerphone able to detect inbalances in conversations.  
A first simple version could be based only on directional microphones and a series of lights to give feedback in a user friendly way.  
A more advanced version could have a voice recognition capabilities to identify individuals, detect interruptions, and maybe also non respectful language.
